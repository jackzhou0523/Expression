=== Auditorium_Day1_Morning ===
Good evening, everyone. Thank you for being here. Tonight, we’re honored to welcome [Speaker Name], who will share their perspective on Gender Study. Please give them a warm welcome! #speaker:Host #portrait:Host
(Polite applause ripples through the audience. The guest speaker steps onto the stage with a confident posture, adjusting the mic. They clear their throat and smile.)
Thank you, thank you. It’s great to be here. I love speaking at universities—so many bright young minds, eager to learn. #speaker:Speaker #portrait:speaker
Wow, quite a crowd tonight. And I see a lot of female students here, huh? #speaker:Speaker #portrait:speaker
(A few students glance at each other, sensing something off.) #speaker: 
(chuckling) You know, I always wonder—why do women work so hard? I mean, wouldn’t life be so much easier if you just found a rich man and settled down? No need to stress over exams and careers when you could just be, well… a wife!#speaker:Speaker #portrait:speaker
(Silence. A few students shift uncomfortably. Some furrow their brows. Others sit completely still, processing what they just heard.) #speaker: 
(smirking, oblivious to the tension) Come on, think about it. What’s the point of women studying so much anyway? It’s not like it really benefits society. Wouldn’t it be more productive if you all just focused on having more kids? That’s what truly helps a nation grow, don’t you think? #speaker:Speaker #portrait:speaker
(The uncomfortable silence snaps. Murmurs ripple through the audience. A few people laugh awkwardly, not sure if he’s serious. Others visibly frown.) #speaker: 
(whispering) Did he seriously just say that? #speaker:StudentA
No way he actually believes this… right? #speaker:StudentB
(The speaker notices the mixed reaction and grins, thinking he's being edgy.)
(shrugging) Oh, come on. Can’t we joke anymore? Or is this another one of those sensitive topics I’m not allowed to mention? #speaker:Speaker #portrait:speaker
(More students whisper. A few shake their heads. One student scoffs loudly.)
Audience member (loudly)That’s not a joke. That’s just sexist. #speaker:Audience #portrait:speaker
(The speaker tenses for a second, then scoffs. They quickly regain composure, but now there’s an edge to their voice.) #speaker:Speaker
(mocking tone) Wow. So this is where we’re at, huh? The woke mob is out in full force. Back in my day, people had a sense of humor. #speaker:Speaker
(Murmurs turn into frustrated voices. The energy in the room shifts from discomfort to clear agitation.)
“That’s disgusting.”“Why did the school even invite this guy?”“He’s literally just insulting us.” #speaker:Crowd
(A voice suddenly shouts from the back.)
(shouting)Apologize! #speaker:StudentB
(The speaker’s grin fades for a second. Then, instead of de-escalating, they double down.)
(sarcastic) Oh, I’m so sorry. I forgot that some people can’t handle a little banter. Maybe we should cancel every joke that hurts someone’s feelings? #speaker:Speaker
(The murmurs grow louder. The frustration spreads. Some students shake their heads while others look visibly angry.) #speaker:
(growing louder)Just admit it was a bad joke!” “This guy’s serious?” “Get off the stage! #speaker:Crowd
(The situation is spiraling. The tension is palpable. Then—a hand taps the player’s shoulder.) #speaker:


What you’re seeing right now is called Heckler’s Veto. #speaker:??? #portrait:Law
Law? What are you doing here? #speaker:You #portrait:default
(calmly) Heckler’s Veto happens when an audience disrupts a speaker to the point where they can no longer continue. Whether that’s justified or not is the real debate. #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
(glancing back) What do you mean? #speaker:You #portrait:default
It’s when a speaker is silenced not by laws or rules, but because the audience reacts so strongly that they can no longer continue. It’s a complicated issue. #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
*I know what that means. But what do we do now? 
    -> 3A
*I don’t know what that means, but I don’t care. I just want to know how to handle this situation.
    ->3B
*I’m not in a rush, and my thirst for knowledge is infinite. I insist on making him explain it right here, in this noisy auditorium.
    ->3C



=== 3A ===
(nodding) Alright, then let me ask you this—what do you think should be done? Should someone be stopped just because people don’t like what they’re saying? #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
    -> CHOICE_4AB
=== 3B ===
(After the player selects this choice, Law’s expression shifts—he crosses his arms and gives you a long, unimpressed stare.) #speaker: 
(flatly) Wow. Love the intellectual curiosity. Truly inspiring. #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
(shrugging) “Not everyone is interested in legal definitions, man. I just want to know what to do next.#speaker:You #portrait:default
(exhales through his nose) Fine. If you’re not interested in why things happen, let’s just talk about what you want to happen. #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
(He gestures toward the chaos in the auditorium.)
(deadpan) So, do we shut the speaker down or uphold their right to speak? #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
    -> CHOICE_4AB
=== 3C ===
No worries, I’m not in a rush, and my thirst for knowledge is infinite. explain it to me right here. #speaker:You #portrait:default
(raising an eyebrow) ...You really want me to do this here? #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
(nodding earnestly) Yes. Right here. Right now. #speaker:You #portrait:default
(The auditorium is chaotic. Voices shouting, students on their feet, security moving in—yet you stand there, completely unbothered, staring at Law expectantly.)
(sighs) Fine. But don’t say I didn’t warn you. #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
(Law attempts to explain while chaos unfolds in the background.)
(off-mic) Hey! I’m not done here! #speaker:Speaker
“BOO!” “Get off the stage!” “Security, do something! #speaker:Crowd
(raising his voice over the noise) Alright! So! Heckler’s Veto is when a speaker— #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
(Sudden feedback screech from the mic. A security guard yells something incomprehensible. A student knocks over a chair. Law barely reacts.)
(talking louder) —is shut down not by official rules, but by public reaction! It’s controversial because some argue that— #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
(A LOUD argument breaks out near you.)
You can’t just say sexist garbage and expect no pushback! #speaker:Student A
But we’re supposed to debate, not shout people down! #speaker:Student B
(nodding sagely) Mhm. Fascinating. Continue. #speaker:You #portrait:default
(Law pinches the bridge of his nose.)
(muttering) I can’t believe I’m explaining this right now… #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
(Despite the pure chaos, he finishes explaining, exasperated.)
(deadpan) Got it? Or would you like a full thesis? #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
* Got it. Let's move on." 
    
* Actually, now that you mention it, what about—" 
    (Law walks away, absolutely done with you.)
-->CHOICE_5AB
=== CHOICE_4AB ===
* [The speaker’s words are unacceptable. They shouldn’t be given a platform.]
* [Even if it’s offensive, he still has the right to speak.]

(Before the player says anything, campus security arrives and contains the scene.)
-> CHOICE_5AB
=== CHOICE_5AB ===
Relax. He paid the content-neutral security fee. We have to ensure his safety no matter what. #speaker:Poli
* Yeah, I know what that is. Let’s get out of here.
    -> 5A
* Wait, what?
    -> 5B

=== 5A ===
(nodding) Yeah, I know how it works. Let’s just go. #speaker:You
(smirking) Alright, alright, no need to show off. #speaker:Poli
(The group exits the auditorium, transitioning to the next scene.)

=== 5B ===
(Poli sighs dramatically, shaking his head.)
You never do your homework, huh? #speaker:Poli
(crossing arms) It’s not that complicated, but fine, let’s break it down.#speaker:Lawrence
(grinning) Okay, imagine this. The school invites a controversial speaker—let’s say, someone arguing that pineapple belongs on pizza.#speaker:Poli
(raising an eyebrow) That’s your example?#speaker:You
(ignoring you) Now, some students hate that idea so much, they want to protest. Maybe even disrupt the event.#speaker:Lawrence
But the school can’t decide which events deserve extra security based on whether they personally agree with the speaker. That would be discrimination.#speaker:Poli
So instead, they charge a flat security fee to all speakers, regardless of their viewpoint.#speaker:Lawrence
(thinking) So it’s… a way to stop the school from unfairly blocking certain people?#speaker:You
(snapping fingers) Exactly. Whether it’s a feminist professor, a conservative politician, or some dude who thinks the moon is fake, they all pay the same price.#speaker:Poli
(serious) It prevents the school from using security costs as an excuse to silence controversial opinions. If they only charged unpopular speakers, that would be a hidden form of censorship.#speaker:Lawrence
(nodding slowly)Huh. So even if people hate the guy, as long as he paid, the school has to protect him.#speaker:You
(grinning) Bingo.#speaker:Poli
* Got it. Let’s get out of here.
    ~LOAD_MAP()
    ->END
* Wait, so what happens if a speaker refuses to pay?
    ->6B
=== 6B ===
(Law and Poli exchange looks, then shrug.)
Simple. No fee, no event.#speaker:Lawrence
(grinning) The school isn’t obligated to host anyone. If a speaker refuses to pay, they just… don’t get to speak here.#speaker:Poli
(frowning) So it’s not a right to speak—it’s a service you pay for?#speaker:You
Exactly. Freedom of speech means the government can’t silence you. It doesn’t mean private institutions have to give you a microphone for free.#speaker:Lawrence
(laughing) Speakers still have options! They can talk on the sidewalk, they can post online, they can rent their own venue. But if they want to use school resources, they gotta follow the rules.#speaker:Poli
(finally getting it) “Okay. That actually makes sense.#speaker:You
* Alright, I get it now. Let’s leave.
