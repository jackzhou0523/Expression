So… do you actually understand what Heckler’s Veto means? #speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law

* Yeah, I get it. It’s when an audience shuts down a speaker by being disruptive.”

* Not really… can you explain it again?”

I get that it’s about people stopping a speaker, but… why is it controversial?#speaker:You
(nodding) Alright, think of it this way: imagine a university invites a scientist who says climate change is real. But a group of students who don’t believe in climate change start yelling, interrupting, and making it impossible for the talk to continue.#speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
That sounds ridiculous.#speaker:You
Now, flip it. Imagine the university invites someone who says climate change is a hoax. And now, it’s the other side that gets angry and disrupts the event.#speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
…So no matter which side does it, it’s still stopping someone from speaking?#speaker:You
Exactly. That’s why it’s a problem. If we allow Heckler’s Veto to work, then technically, anyone can shut down a speaker just by making enough noise.#speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
(You walk in silence for a moment, processing the idea.)
Huh. I never thought about it that way.#speaker:You
(smirking) Most people don’t. But that’s why discussions like this matter.#speaker:Lawrence #portrait:Law
